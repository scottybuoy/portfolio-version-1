# Portfolio Website

A simple, navigable portfolio website displaying past projects.

## Description

This was an opportunity to implement both the HTML and CSS skills learned so far in the program. 
With a fairly axiomatic site layout, the user can easily decide upon landing on the page where to 
navigate, choosing between a past work section, about section, and form for contacting.


### Dependencies

* Runs in the browser of course!
